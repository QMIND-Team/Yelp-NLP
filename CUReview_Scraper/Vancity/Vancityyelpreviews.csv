"33/100The staff were very friendly and although I am not a customer, Ekatarina the teller,  took the time to explain  how their Visa gift cards work. The renos look great! I hope all banks look like that one day! My GPS was directing me to their branch on Royal Oak, but I am glad I stumbled upon this one on Kingsway."
"one of the nicer ones with its high glass ceilings.good location being close to dt w/o the traffic.Own parking on Quebec side, about 8 spots &amp; one can walk thru the parkade to main lobby via elevator, without getting wet.Usually no need to line up long."
"Love this CBD location because they open early 8am but are closed weekends, just not enough people living close by.Good seating area at the front."

"Has been my first and only bank.I gave oportunity to the big ones and they disappointed me.Vancity gives you personal attention, speak your language and give me great products that work for me."
"It is a recently new bank either in 2012 or 2013 if I am not mistaken. Before, I would usually pass by this area when I would take the 130 bus home from school. Going on, the bank feels like a breath of fresh air. Seeing the customers are happy with the customer service, I feel like this type of bank/credit union will do well in the long run."

"Though there's metered parking in this tight street, there's underground parking, a decent amount of a dozen spots.Usually long lineup but the workers here are pro's, move pretty fast.Well lit here."

"Closed MondaysThis neighbourhood branch is very small and feels more like an office than a bank.The staff are very efficient and friendlyThe only odd thing is the way they do the safety deposit boxes, they allow the customers to go behind the counter to sign the card but not allow to get to the box, they have to bring it to you then you have to go to the tiny closet to do your thing. So you can stand right outside the giant safe doors and see them count money, etc. but not allow to cross the threshold, not very safe at all.They don't even have a security guard so be aware if you do business at this branch."

"One of 2 vancity locations in the city of Richmond, this one in particular being the most central and accessible of the 2. This vancity is located at the base of an office building on the corner of Westminster HWY and #3 Rd.Theres not much to say about this branch other than, Its AC'ed, its very spacious, offers free coffee, lots of staff on hand, and everyone is very nice.No frills Five, out of Five."

"Anytime a bank/credit union has their own parking, esp. covered, even better, entrance/exit on the side street plus free Hastings st. except during rush hour.Just something about corner locations that's exciting ;)Lots of tellers, compared to Chinatown &amp; Main/Terminal."

"Clearly I've been out of the loop and my bank no longer carries visa gift cards, so luckily Vancity does so I came here. I was helped immediately and got the three gift cards I wanted.The sole reason I knocked down a star is because they charge a monthly fee for the gift card from when the gift card is loaded. I absolutely hate that they do it like phone cards that you're dinged from the day you start. I feel like since I had to pay $2 to even get a blank gift card, surely they could roll in the fees in that $2 or make the initial fee higher. I don't want to gift these to my clients and be like ""FYI, you want to use it quickly or else every month they ding the balance of the gift I gave you"". My bank's former card charged a flat fee for the person purchasing the gift card and no monthly maintenance fee gets taken from the balance."

"I've been going here for years because it's close to my home, but OMG it has to be the slowest branch in town. I keep coming back trying to give this place the benefit of the doubt. But there is no sense of urgency here and a sullen atmosphere that feels like an institution. There are a couple smilie faces that definitely help bring this branch to life, but I don't think it's worth it to come here anymore. I'll drive the extra few miles to go to another branch. Wow this place needs some inspiration."

"I love Vancity.They're always really friendly, really quick and efficient.My father and I opened an account when I was about 8, and I still have the same account. No fees (other than overdraft) and it is super easy to set up savings accounts. I do most of my banking online and their website is really easy to navigate.I love all the work they do for the community as well!"

"Oh the dreaded banks. But wait, VanCity is not a bank - it's a credit union! Yay! They're community based with an interest in investing in the community - how often do you find that in the corporate world?!They have some great account options, and some even greater visa card options. When you get an enviro visa, with every purchase that you make with that card, a small portion is donated to local environmental projects. Spending money never felt so good!"
"I am happy with my account from Vancity. It's great -- fees are super low and I do online banking for no charge (pay bills etc). Also, the just introduced mobile banking -- yup, banking from your cel phone. They were actually way ahead of the banks in terms of a lot of technology -- like cheque imaging. Why no five stars? Well, I am holding a grudge against a ""customer service representative"" at this branch -- my branch. Credit unions are supposed to be known for their friendly customer service. I went into this branch to get a roll of quarters for laundry. The guy (dressed in a rugby shirt) rolled his eyes at me and asked if I was a member. I said yes. ""Are you a member of this branch?"" I said yes. ""Do you have your member card?"" I said yes, and gave it to him. He checked out my info, made a comment about my shirt before giving me my change. A) He didn't need to confirm my membership in the CU to give me change. B) Buying quarters with cash does not require him snooping in my account info. C) He shouldn't have made a snide comment about a member's choice of apparel.  D) It was obviously laundry day, cut me some slack!!  (I was wearing a bright green shirt that said ""Green shirts are for pimps."")Although that guy needs some customer service tune-up sessions, my other experiences with Vancity have been fine -- I rarely need to visit the branch since everything is available online. There's also free transfers to other Vancity members (handy for paying back a friend who bought lunch) and ding-free ATM use at any Credit Union in the province."

"Nope.  We called in for a fair and fast loan. The employee instructed us that our credit was good but there was an outstanding debt on husband's credit, but they couldn't tell us the credit bureau.  We called every credit bureau and there was nothing.  After 5 hours on the phone back and forth between vancity, credit bureaus and Telus we realised that there was no balance and Telus flat out stated ""your bank can't read.""We emailed in all of our documents. Pay stubs,  (even though he cashes his cheques there every 2 weeks), letter showing a zero balance from telus, ID. .. only to have her phone us back at the last minute to tell us that because my husband isn't a permanent resident he doesn't qualify and my income isn't enough on its own because of our car payment.  Thanks for wasting 3 days and giving me migraine after migraine. We've been with them 6 months and were promised relationship - based banking. What we got was, ""Yes, I should have looked at your stuff in the beginning. It was my fault. OK,  bye. "" Didn't even offer to waive banking fees for a little bit. We're closing our accounts and this bank will he missing out on our mortgage next year."

"Always friendly. Just like all Vancity locations, this location has the same warm and friendly atmosphere. I find that this branch typically has more tellers open than some of the smaller branches. Extra Star: Free coffee. I think every time I've been here, there is free coffee (self serve). It might be on weekends only, not sure"

"Friendly, fast service even when there is a line-up! I get the feeling that they are a good working team and help each other when needed. I over heard a man who works there say that he will wait to go on his coffee break so he can help the credit union members in line and proceeded to open up another teller station!Staff remember my name too!"
"One of the older branches, in terms of building, for a Vancity. This one is tucked away, right across from the trailer park, out here in Coquitlam. You cannot miss it, there really is nothing in terms of business's around this location.I like coming to this branch, as I work around this area, and the staff are very friendly, and most of them have been at this location for a long time. If you come here often, they also know your name, and say hello, and how you doing. Even the security guard here is friendly and talks to the regulars.They have a good sized customer parking lot, and they are open from Monday to Saturday."
