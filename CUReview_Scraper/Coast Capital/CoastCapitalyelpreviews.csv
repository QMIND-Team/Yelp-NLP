"The staff is very friendly and go out of their way to help you with your financial needs. We were lured here by the fee free banking and haven't been unhappy since. They truly don't charge fees for practically anything! That is great considering the banking community is consistently trying to find ways to nickle and dime every customer they have. I'm glad that we have a great credit union here in Richmond. Another big plus. Even though there aren't that many branches, you can use the ABM of any other credit union or HSBC branch in Canada without incurring any fees. That is very convenient."

"I've been banking with Coast Capital since I was a kid in 1995, when it was still Pacific Coast Savings. I have stayed with them because I have always gotten good customer service and they offer a free chequing account and competitive mortgage rates. Last year, I got my first mortgage with them and was very impressed with the time, patience, and education they provided me as a first-time home buyer. I also shopped around and got a mortgage broker, but I ended up going with Coast because they were able to match the best rate (prime -0.70%) and even threw in a $1000 RRSP contribution and $500 cash as a bonus.There aren't many branches or ATMs, but you can use any credit union ATMs (like Vancity) without getting dinged."

"This is my bank. The staff are helpful and efficient plus, some of them remember me and make each visit a pleasant task.  The location is perfect.The interior is always clean.Not one complaint about this location. I recommend Coast Capital to most people."
"There should be a no star option! One screw up after another with Coast Capital Loosing. Been banking with them for over 15 years and they really went downhill. They act like kids in a candy store - jumping from one idea to another, creating a big confusion for customers and even employees. The employees have big targets to hit, so they are forced to push products at people whether they need them or not. I find it very unprofessional. I was very upset when a family member was sold a product they not only didn't need, but it actually hurt them. You really have to count your fingers after you shake hands with Coast Capital! They bribe customers in by offering ""free"" banking. But it's not true. They charge for basic customer service such as photocopy and statements - this is ridiculous!"

"OK, so let me give you the good and the bad for this Credit Union as a whole, not just this particular branch.The Good: 1)No fees, this is exactly why I chose this Credit Union. 2) The locations are usually open when you need them. 3) You can use other credit unions' bank machines as well as the HSBC ones with no fees.The Bad:1) Just like with any other financial institution, your experience as a customer really depends on how good your account executive and the branch managers are. I have worked with some great people as well as with some very incompetent ones which seem to be trained to say ""no"", ""can't"" and ""sorry"".2) Technology, if new banking features are important to you, just don't bank here. Let me give you a few examples: It took them forever to finally offer debit cards with the chip, every other financial institution had this a year or two before they did. The new feature of depositing cheques by taking a pic that is being offered by Westminster Savings and other institutions is probably a year or two away. The mobile banking app also took a couple of years longer than with other institutions."

"""And once you find the house of cement boxes, just cross over the bubbling moat and enter the world of fun money.""  That's what I was told by guy pushing a shopping cart when I was looking for the downtown branch of Coast Capital.  It IS quite an entrance, but once inside it's the same ol' Coast Capital that I've come to know and love.  Never a huge line, always lots of friendly employees ready to help and best of all, none of those ""banking"" rules that make us hate banks so much. I like being a part owner of my money's house and couldn't ever see myself going back to a regular bank."

"I thought I'd add a new posting specifically for this branch of Coast Capital because i have been so impressed consistently with their services. I don't use CCS for my primary banking, but I have an account with them because I'm a signing authority for a non-profit. When I first signed up the woman who I was working with was incredibly knowledgeable and clearly loved her job and working for CSS. She offered right off the bat to set me up with someone to review my loans and financing to see if CCS could offer me anything better. She was really enthusiastic about making sure that I had everything I needed has since checked in twice. It may be her job, but I've never had a banker be that helpful when it was clear I was just opening an account because I had to. Since then I've had amazing interactions with the staff whenever I've had to update anything as a singing authority or if anything has come up.  All the front desk staff are super friendly and helpful and knowledgeable and I strongly recommend if you live in James Bay and bank with CSS make this your home branch."

"Have been banking with them since I started working as a teenager. Now as a young adult, living on my own, they have been nothing but difficult! Booked a routine money chat and was told I wasn't making enough money for their liking and to come back when I had a second job. Months later, I return with a better paying job inquiring about an auto loan again (this was my second appointment regarding one.) Once again, I was turned away for simply being ""too young and not established."" (my credit score is excellent and Ive never paid late.) After I tried to stress the importance of having a reliable vehicle due to being a courier and how my car was about to die, he told me to have a good day. 15mins after I left this branch, my car proceeded to blow its engine. I have no intent on returning to this bank for anything. Unless you are a very well off middle aged person, please DO NOT bank with this union."

I have been banking at this location for 20 years. I have never had to pay a fee for using my debit card ever.  The tellers have always been friendly and very helpful with any questions I have had. If you have to do other types of banking like loans  etc I have found the one on one experience very fast and helpful. I have always felt like a member of the family there and will keep using this location as my number one banking option.

"I wanted to clean out my account into a cashier's check made out to the firm I have mutual funds with.No hard sell at the teller about retaining any monies in my account (thought I wasn't also closing my account per se).A cashier's cheque would normally be $10, but the teller noticed I had a chequing account. I explained I had no cheques. She suggested instead I move all monies into the chequing account, and then she could print a couple of cheques for me. 20 cents each normally but she offered to waive that fee.Points for looking for a cheaper alternative, and for waiving a trivial fee."

"Thought Montana's might be a good place to go instead of the Keg after seeing their flyer in the mail. Cant go wrong with an $19 steak right?      When we arrived around 8:00pm it was pretty quiet and we were seated by the kid working at the front. Took about 5 minutes for a waitress to notice we were there and issued our menus. While we were waiting I saw that their ventilation system had problems. There is a lot.. everywhere.. especially on the 'moose head' above our table.      It was awkward waiting exactly 25 minutes for our food to arrive. We decided to order the '7oz steak with 6 shrimp' for $23. I was shocked to see what looked like the tiny piece of meat leftover for the dog with charcoaled shrimp nicely overdone and a dixie cup of can bean.. i was expecting green beans not can beans that will make me fart the rest of the night on my date.      Thanks, but no thanks Montana's"
