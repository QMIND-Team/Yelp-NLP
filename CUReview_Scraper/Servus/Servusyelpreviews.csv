"It's a great bank with great people. It's good to know that they're not in it to make money for some random investor on Bay Street. Always helpful, professional and thorough!"

"I was there on Thursday at around 5:30 pm and they close at 7. I was depositing my money with the teller. All of a sudden the branch manager came up to me in a really mean tone and said. Don't come in so late if you are making so many deposits cause we only have one teller. Â It seems like he is having a bad day.Well, I guess he doesn't like customers coming in. Then I will deposit my money somewhere else.I have never been treated like this at a bank or a union so please do not come to this branch or you will be treated like dirt. All the staff that works there are rude, they need to be trained. Absolutely disrespectful to customer. I do not recommend anyone to bank here.I forgot to mention that he was swearing at me cause I tried to ignore him."
"I love love LOVE my bank! I have been coming to this location before it was a Servus lol I have found memories at this branch of going to the bank with my Mom or Dad when I was little. The tellers know me by name, they know my family, they ask about things in my life, this bank is like my cheers! This branch has remained very much the same over the years, tellers have changed, but many have been there for over 15 years! The hours are great, only closed on the normal stat holidays. This bank has been very helpful over the years, so many memories, who can say that about a bank?I used to work in Capilano Mall for 8 years, so this branch was helpful with all my retail needs as well. They do a lot of charity/fundraisers for the community, and I am proud to be a Servus member!"

"I've been with Bank X since I signed up for my very first kids account when I was very, very young. My fiance has been with Bank Y for around the same amount of time. When we took the big leap for a joint account, we decided to start fresh with Bank Z, AKA Servus Credit Union.It's only been a couple of months, but so far, we're very happy. The hours at this Southgate location are very convenient and the staff are among the most helpful bank staff I've encountered.Because Servus isn't a big, rich bank, some of the perks just aren't there. There's online banking, but you can't connect your Servus account to any institutions. That means having to go in any time I want to transfer money, but honestly, the staff are so nice I really don't mind."

"I do not have much good to say about Servus credit union They went out of their way to destroy a family. A family that had paid them over $250,000 in interest only in 4 years plus all the principle payments then they got a new employee in that had a personal vendetta against me (do not know why did not even know the person) when he had succeed in finishing me off he left the bank. I owed them just over a million dollars with assets to cover the debt and by forcing me to sell at that time (2008) they made me lose 1.3 million plus they put a judgement on me because i was short on paying them. So a long story short I lost everything (2.6 million dollars) and am left with nothing but a judgement that I can not pay I hope karma works its magic"

"This facility is fantastic. They have a wonderful indoor water park that is never closed to the public. The indoor playground is perfect in the winter. The gym is well maintained, clean and ecstatically pleasing. The indoor running/walking track is perfect for training, cool down and sprinting. With two ice rinks, two indoor soccer fields and two basketball courts I see people playing all the time. The leisure rink which has two bouncy castles in the summer is perfect for the little ones. My only complaint is the open concept showers in the pool area are not my cup of tea. The gym showers are a button you press and gives you 30 seconds of water. It's kinda annoying. But other then that I love this gym. I also love the membership options. You can buy month to month or sign contract for a discount. They have a couple of options for the contracts and the annual gives you the best bank for your buck. Their child minding is also a great option for parents. I have used it and it was perfect."

If you're still banking at one of the mainstream banks and are not happy about that nagging feeling that you politely pad the corporate coffers with all of your fees that nickel and dime (these days it's more like loonie and toonie) their way out of your account then maybe it's time to try out a credit union.I'm not staff but I certainly have come to know all of them well over the years. This is one of the most enjoyable branches I have set foot in. I like the fact that the people hear actually get to know you and treat you like a person instead of an account.I also give this branch props for being such a huge and consistent supporter of the South West Edmonton Farmers Market (SWEFM for those in the know).
"Very disappointed - I just needed a checking account because my employer required it to deposit my paycheck (they no longer give a hard copy of our paychecks) so I thought I would open a checking account at Servus because I had seen their blaring advertisements about how good they are. I guess they are too good for me because I was denied a checking account based on my credit score! Never heard of such a ridiculous requirement to open a checking account that would contain my own money - I was not asking to have them extend a line of credit or anything that would make me a risk for their establishment. They need to review their absurd policies. Meanwhile, if any of you do not have an above average credit score, don't waste your time going there."

"I am an on-line banker through and through and rarely go into a branch unless I need to speak to someone. I have always been pleased with the service I receive at this bank and don't have any desire to switch banks at all. I recently decided to talk to a financial planner at the baseline branch as I am really trying to get everything in order so I can purchase my first home. Leah Beck is AWESOME!!!!!! She helped me work through everything, helped me make a budget, and set up all my auto transfers so that I really don't even have to really think about it. Leah is easy to talk to and I can relate really well with her. She really understands where I am coming from (even when I make her budget in $50/month to get my nails done). Never once got the 'I'm being lectured' feeling from her. In fact, she commended me on my money management skills and agreed that I had the right idea - I just needed a guideline to follow. Best part about the whole thing - she agreed that my Ex-bf is a big A$$ (holding me to a loan I cosigned 5 years into our 7.5 year relationship for him because his credit is so effed he can't finance anything on his own - nor will he put the effort in to selling it - btw - if anyone reading this knows what I can do about that without getting screwed over let me know!!!!!) - this was the selling point for me!! Thanks for being on my side Leah!!! :) ...haha, the financial advise was good too! I would highly recommend talking to Leah if you are having trouble budgeting in general, or if you want to know the best way to financially achieve a goal you may have in mind. She's just great!"

"I've always gotten good service from this branch and enjoyed going here (as much as you can enjoy a bank!). I used to go quite often as I worked nearby and had to deposit my cheques, and I got to know the tellers and to a lesser degree the bank manager. I've started going again as I work close by again, and the manager is still the same lady that was there five years ago. The staff are all really pleasant in a genuine way and do their jobs well. I've never had a problem here. There's usually not a line or more than one or two people ahead of me, and when there is a line I haven't ever had to wait more than five minutes. This branch isn't open on the weekend so it's definitely handier for people that work nearby during weekdays."
"I applied for a loan for a car. Pretty standard fare. When I got the call to say Yeh or no, I got an earful. The lady was polite, didn't cuss and treated me like a sack of meat.Her first question out of the gate was, ""So are you comfortable with your age and lack of RRSP's?"" It turned into a big argument, where I felt I had to justify myself as to why I'm so broke. Yep, it's true, I'm old. Yep. I'm broke too. I just wanted a truck.I wrote a complaint on their website and haven't heard back since. I pulled all my business from them. The lady I was originally working with, was quite fantastic. I don't know where this other lady came from and don't know where she's going, but I know I will never deal with the disgusting BANK again.Ever. Oh yeah, the lady lied to me. She was making up IT sounding words and making it sound like a computer issue, when in fact, I worked in IT for five years, went to NAIT in the Computer Systems Technology Program for two and she's saying they need two pay periods to hit their vaults because of the micro dot encoding. Pretty poor lie. I guess she felt I was not only old, broke, but stupid too.The first lady I talked with was polite and nice and very easy to deal with. It really built up my hopes. I thought I was really going to be treated like a human. She was everything I thought a bank person should be. Personable, polite, professional. She's the reason these guys got one star (and the fact I can't give them Zero)The Manager is a woman. The Assistant manager is a woman. Most of the tellers are women. I think this place is probably a hen house where some of the staff get off dictating the members on what to do because they have the money and the position. Not sure and don't care enough to find out.Run far, run fast. I hope I spare you the pain and indignity that I went through. I think this is what Yelp is for."
