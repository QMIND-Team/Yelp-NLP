"It's a little weird to walk into a supposed bank branch and see nothing but a few desks and a couch.That being said, the staff at the Bell-Trinity branch of Meridian Credit Union are really awesome, and for the first time I felt a really advantage to having a ""real"" bank rather than the online-only accounts I've had since university.The only downside is that the building's ATM isn't accessible after 6pm."

"Friendly staff, fast service, more than competetive rates.  My Mom is always greeted by name when she visits, and that really appeals to her!"

Meridian may not be an underdog in the true sense but in the banking world they certainly are. I popped in here to get a cheque certified. The teller let me know that there would be a $15 fee and that it had to be paid in cash. As I did not have cash he offered to get the certification process started while I ran across the street to Scotia. When I got back he was wrapping everything up with his manager. I was quickly out the door without any hassle.Great friendly customer service provided even to someone who isn't a Meridian customer.April challenge 11/30

Branch is in an industrial area and very confusing to get inside of if you haven't been before. Hours are abysmal if you are doing any kind of personal banking (only open till 4pm)Also very annoying since you HAVE to go to the branch you signed up at to do a lot of things you could do at any branch with another bank.
