"To put it simply, I don't like traditional banks.  They are set up for one thing and one thing only -- to rip you off.  We could do much better without the Wells Fargo's and US Banks of this world.One way I do better is to be a member of a credit union and Affinity Plus is one of the best.  I've been able to walk into the credit union and walk out with a loan.  The staff is exceptional.  They act like they want to see you.  You are not a number.  And, they don't fee you to death.  My ATM is free.  Occasional, accidental, overdrafts have been refunded through their point system.  Debit cards can be issued instantly.  Debit purchase disputes have been handled swiftly and professionally and I have not lost any money.  In short, Affinity Plus wants to help you keep your money in your account, not theirs.  My suggestion (and their slogan), is to ditch your bank!"

"we spent more than an hour there today trying to do international wire transfer.  first of all the staff, kenny who assisted us, was very inexperienced and did not know what to do.  after getting help from various people and spending an hour, he told us it was successful.  but then when the Superior came and review the work, he said overdid many area. after an hour spending there and 40 minutes driving back and forth. we received a call that there was a signature missing so that they could not do the transfer and we have to go back.  they will not offer any compensation for the loss due to their unprofessional work."

This branch moved to another location. They are now next to Shop Rote in the Middletown Shopping Center on Route 35 North.
"This banking entity (as a credit union) of which I am a member, has some serious flaws in its technology, despite promoting itself as a ""hipster"" financial enterprise. If you want to have a phone call to your smartphone to verify your ownership everytime you login to your bank account, this is the entity you want to bank with. If you want to have problems at virtually every branch they have, again this is the enterprise that you want. Most recently, I had my card absconded as I inserted it into a 24 hour ATM, with the message immediately following, this ""ATM is out of service."" When the opening screen returned I checked with another bank card to see if it was working and the ATM was miraculously back in service. That was at their Piscataway branch. This happened after I had gone to the New Brunswick branch to do a deposit, only to be told by the machine, ATM ""cannot process this transaction, please go to a branch location."" I  use this bank infrequently, but it seems that almost 50% of my transactions run into problems. I  once used an inside teller machine at the Flemington branch, and while the machine was taking my deposit, it went kaput and became inoperable, before the transaction was completed. I had to get the branch manager to reboot the branch teller machine to have the transaction show up as posted to my bank account. Credit unions are a great concept but this credit union has major technology flaws, despite hiring only younger people. If you want to use an entity for banking that requires you to receive a phone call with a special security code that you have to enter online everytime you want to check your bank account with a PC, this is the one to choose. Apparently, the IT department is not aware of the internet sub-protocol, DHCP, which has been an industry-standard technology practice for more than 20 years, and the probable impetus behind the very time-consuming and impractical ""security enhancement."" Most banking enterprises use personal security questions and cookies kept on your PC to verify account ownership. However, not Affinity. But in all fairness, it does have smartphone access for your accounts, with very limited functionality, that do not require multiple stages of security, and are easy to use.  So, if you want a bank that inconveniently adds an unnecessary and cumbersome layer of security just to check your bank accounts from a PC (whether it is your usual PC or not), or a financial entity that will refuse your check deposit, or confiscate your bank card during the shopping holiday, this is the one for you."

"Been doing business with Affinity Credit Union since 2006! Mostly with car loans. We've had 3 loans through them and they have ALWAYS been pleasant to work with. The first car loan was with the Southside location but this location has served us tremendously when we lived in the area and needed to do business. TIP!!! Lowest interest rates for car loans here compared to other banks and credit unions for us. APR of 2.49% for a used 2015. (We both have excellent credit scores too)We get approved very quickly. Our loan officer was Evan. Great guy to work with!Very professional employees. Always very helpful and goes above and beyond to help us understand.This location is located a block right behind Firestone tire factory. Very easy to get right off of second Avenue.They stay consistently busy so don't be surprised if there is a little bit of a wait. They handle transactions swiftly and professionally when they get busy though. They remodeled the inside and is very functional, inviting, and modern. Drive through is in back. Kind of hidden but it's there."

If you want to have a phone call to your smartphone to verify your ownership everytime you login to your bank account, this is the entity you want to bank with. If you want to have problems at virtually every branch they have, again this is the enterprise that you want. Most recently, I had my card absconded as I inserted it into a 24 hour ATM, with the message immediately following, this ""ATM is out of service."" When the opening screen returned I checked with another bank card to see if it was working and the ATM was miraculously back in service. That was at their Piscataway branch. This happened after I had gone to the New Brunswick branch to do a deposit, only to be told by the machine, ATM ""cannot process this transaction, please go to a branch location."" I  use this bank infrequently, but it seems that almost 50% of my transactions run into problems. I  once used an inside teller machine at the Flemington branch, and while the machine was taking my deposit, it went kaput and became inoperable, before the transaction was completed. I had to get the branch manager to reboot the branch teller machine to have the transaction show up as posted to my bank account. Credit unions are a great concept but this credit union has major technology flaws, despite hiring only younger people. If you want to use an entity for banking that requires you to receive a phone call with a special security code that you have to enter online everytime you want to check your bank account with a PC, this is the one to choose. Apparently, the IT department is not aware of the internet sub-protocol, DHCP, which has been an industry-standard technology practice for more than 20 years, and the probable impetus behind the very time-consuming and impractical ""security enhancement."" Most banking enterprises use personal security questions and cookies kept on your PC to verify account ownership. However, not Affinity. But in all fairness, it does have smartphone access for your accounts, with very limited functionality, that do not require multiple stages of security, and are easy to use.  So, if you want a bank that inconveniently adds an unnecessary and cumbersome layer of security just to check your bank accounts from a PC (whether it is your usual PC or not), or a financial entity that will refuse your check deposit, or confiscate your bank card during the shopping holiday, this is the one for you."

"I would not recommend this place just on this experience alone, but this is not the first experience at this bank.ATM machines are constantly down or being serviced. This is the second time I have deposited money and my money was taken. The first time thank god the branch was open because they were able to give me my money back immediately, but today not really. I went to deposit money on a Sunday the machine did the same thing and I was able to pull out some money it kept some, I quickly called customer service , they said systems were down and wouldn't be able to help me to call back, I called back and the next agent said there should be no problem just go to the branch, went to branch they said they would look into, (look into .Give me my money back), I then called to make a complaint they call me from the branch in two seconds to tell me they are still looking into it. My money should be safe with your bank, I should feel comfortable that the issue with a customer and your on going issues with the ATM should be resolved by the end of day. Poor , Poor , Poor, I have sent people to the branch because it is convenient and the people are pleasant, but this is unacceptable. There is always an issue with your machines in and out of the bank. Always..08/13/2018After hours of waiting for a response for my money to be refunded, they call me at the end of the day to tell me I have to wait one more day because they can do nothing until some special technician comes and does something special with the machine... Thanks Affinity Bank for you stellar service.. if I could give a 0 I would 08/14/2018I received a call this afternoon about my credit being given, I was told yesterday that it would have been ok to close my account and that I should escalate it. I actually was in the process of making the call before you called me. Thank you for fixing my issue, it did cause me stress but overall I'm glad it was fixed. 08/15/2018"

"Friendly service, good hours and easy access from exit 30 on I-287.  This Affinity FCU branch has never made a mistake with my transactions and are helpful (if not so fast), so has been all good for me.On my last visit Ramesh (the teller who's always there) pointed out that I had money in a savings account earning almost nothing, and if he typed a few magic keystrokes into his computer and I signed a piece of paper, my savings account would instantly start earning about three times as much interest. So that made me a fan right there!This location in the Country Mile (Rt 202) also has safety deposit boxes."

"I will always be baffled by the ratings on Yelp. For example, I've been with Affinity Plus for decades. When our mortgage was resold over and over, we got tired and took out the mortgage at Affinity Plus, just for peace of mind. Turns out the previous bank, Washington Mutual, was headed for the graveyard, so our abandoning that ship was a very fortunate accident. But then there's all the rest of the banking business such as IRAs and car loans. Done most of them. Always to satisfactory results. I have to think the complainers know little about finance. I worked in banks for a couple of decades. I know what is good and what not. And I wholeheartedly endorse Affinity Plus. America is discount dystopia. And I see people who are of that mindset. Good luck to them because they'll always be grumping about their experience."

"Been banking here since I was old enough to bank.  Affinity Plus offers service that cannot be rivaled by any main stream bank, period.  I have yet to find better interest rates, better service, or a bank that gives me a loan with a simple email in a matter of minutes.When I first started banking here you could only get an account if you worked for a certain company or if you had a family member with an account.  They ditched that policy so they could grow a bit which concerns me but so far they're just as wonderful as they were prior to that.  BEST BANK EVER!"

"Been banking here since I was old enough to bank.  Affinity Plus offers service that cannot be rivaled by any main stream bank, period.  I have yet to find better interest rates, better service, or a bank that gives me a loan with a simple email in a matter of minutes.When I first started banking here you could only get an account if you worked for a certain company or if you had a family member with an account.  They ditched that policy so they could grow a bit which concerns me but so far they're just as wonderful as they were prior to that.  BEST BANK EVER!"

"I will always be baffled by the ratings on Yelp. For example, I've been with Affinity Plus for decades. When our mortgage was resold over and over, we got tired and took out the mortgage at Affinity Plus, just for peace of mind. Turns out the previous bank, Washington Mutual, was headed for the graveyard, so our abandoning that ship was a very fortunate accident. But then there's all the rest of the banking business such as IRAs and car loans. Done most of them. Always to satisfactory results. I have to think the complainers know little about finance.
